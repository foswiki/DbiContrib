---++ Usage

This contrib is used to abstract Database access from other Contribs.
It assumes that all Contribs and Plugins are talking to the same Database, and has not been built for scalability or speed yet.

To configure it, goto the Extensions::DbiContrib section of =configure= (near the end).
The ={DbiContrib}{DBI_dsn}= specifies the 'DBI DSN'
'dbi' : {the database type} : {the database name} : {the host}. ={DbiContrib}{DBI_username}= and ={DbiContrib}{DBI_password}= need to be a database user that has permission to log in from the host Foswiki is running on.
