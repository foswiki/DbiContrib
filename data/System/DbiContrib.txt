---++ Usage

This Contrib is used to abstract database access from other Contribs.

To configure the default database, goto the =Extensions::DbiContrib= section of =configure= (near the end).
The ={DbiContrib}{DBI_dsn}= specifies the "DBI DSN"
'dbi' : {the database type} : {the database name} : {the host}. ={DbiContrib}{DBI_username}= and ={DbiContrib}{DBI_password}= 
need to be a database user that has permission to log in from the host Foswiki is running on.

Other Contribs can specify different DBI DSN's and options.
